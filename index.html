<p>The Bash Bunny is a dynamic USB attack platform developed and distributed by Hak5. The Bash Bunny was released in 2017 with immense community support and payload development commenced shortly after release. The Bash Bunny was an expansion of the popular USB Rubber Ducky with greater functionality and can mimic trusted USB devices and execute preprogrammed attacks, so the offensive capabilities and applications vary. The Bash Bunny may be configured and reconfigured between a human interface device (HID) (think keyboard, similar to Rubber Ducky), ethernet adapter, or mass storage; as such, the device is dynamic and may be reconfigured to meet desired needs and systems.  </p>

<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>

<h3 id="os">Operating System: Windows</h3>
<p>	This primer paper on the Bash Bunny is written and intended for Windows machines, specifically Windows 10. Mac and Linux devices may have differing commands and verbiage that may confuse and impede would-be users from following this paper. For example, to share ethernet with the Bash Bunny the ATTACKMODE for Windows is RNDIS_ETHERNET; on Mac/Linux/Android devices the standard is ECM_ETHERNET. The ethernet configuration example above is just one of the many differences between device configuration; if on a device other than Windows this primer may still be read for concept even though many configuration settings will be different. </p>
<h3 id="user">User: High School Seniors</h3>
<p>	This primer paper is written and intended to introduce high school seniors to the Bash Bunny with the intention of being the basis of a Senior Project over the course of several weeks.  </p>

<h2 id="device">Device</h2>
<p>The Bash Bunny looks like a standard USB device with a switch and an LED light. There are three modes by default on the Bash Bunny that are accessible via the switch on the side of the device. There are two ‘attack modes’ (switch positions 1 &amp; 2), and the arming mode (switch position 3). By default, switch position 3, arming mode, is utilized to enable and manage serial and mass storage. Any modifications to the payloads in the switch 1 or 2 folders on the device will be conducted while the Bash Bunny is in arming mode. The following image, taken from the Hak5 wiki page for the Bash Bunny, illustrates the three switch positions. </p>
<img src="./index_files/screenshots/hak5bashbunny.png" alt="Hak5 Bash Bunny picture indicating switch positions" height="250">
<h3 id="additional-notes">Additional notes</h3>
<p>(1)	While it is possible to configure switch position 3, arming mode to perform another payload when the device is plugged in, that functionality and configuration is outside the scope of this primer paper. (2) The Bash Bunny should be ejected and unplugged prior to changing the switch position on the device. For example, while in arming mode a payload is added to the switch position one folder--the device should be ejected from the computer, unplugged, switch changed to switch position 1, then plugged back into the computer. (3) Do not edit payloads directly on/from the Bash Bunny. Copy and paste the files to be edited onto your local machine.</p>


<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>As a dynamic attack platform, the Bash Bunny may be viewed as complex and the operation of the device as overwhelming to any who have not previously configured or utilized the device. The steps below should be taken in order to configure the Bash Bunny. </p>

<h3 id="setup-update">Initial Setup &amp; Update</h3>

<ol>
  <li value="1"> Plug Bash Bunny into computer while in arming mode (switch position 3). </li>
  <li value="2"> Navigate to the downloads section at the Hak5 site at the following url: https://downloads.hak5.org/bunny</li>
  <li value="3"> Scroll down to the section titled “Bash Bunny Tools” and download the corresponding version for your machine by pressing the cloud download button. </li>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="./index_files/screenshots/bashbunnytools.png" alt="Hak5 Bash Bunny tools download screenshot" height="250"></li>
      <li>When the popup window appears select “Save File.” If you have previously elected to automatically perform the action of saving skip this step. </li>
    </ul>
  <li value="4">Navigate to your Downloads and select the file that was just downloaded. Extract all to the root of the Bash Bunny. Do not nest the extraction within any folders. </li>
  <li value="5">From the Bash Bunny, double click to run ‘bunnyupdater.exe.’ The executable should have a red circle as the icon.  </li>
    <img src="./index_files/screenshots/bunnyupdater.png" alt="Bash Bunny directory to show bunnyupdater" height="300">
